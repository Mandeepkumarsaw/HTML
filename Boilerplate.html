Variable-Length Encoding: UTF-8 encodes characters in one to four bytes. For example:

1 byte for standard ASCII characters (0 to 127).

2 bytes for characters from 128 to 2047.

3 bytes for characters from 2048 to 65535.

4 bytes for characters from 65536 to 1114111.

Bit Patterns: The encoding uses specific bit patterns to differentiate between one-byte, two-byte, three-byte, and four-byte sequences. Here's a basic look:

1-byte: 0xxxxxxx (where x represents the bits of the character).

2-byte: 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx.

3-byte: 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx.

4-byte: 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx. 

Note---

R color store value from = 0 to 255
G color store value from = 0 to 255
B color store value from = 0 to 255  , you can check further In RGB color website.


Rgb can br 24bits,30bits,48bits, etc means it must divisible by 3 and shouls be equal divided
If R=8, Then G=8bits & B=8bits
If R=9, then G=9bits & B=9bits
 hence more bit requires more space and 
 more bit is responsible for image quality ie more bit , higher quality
 generally DSLr photos are of 48 bits means R=G=B=16.....
